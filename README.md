# Lemmings Arcade Game

## Description
Developed in 2020, "Lemmings Arcade Game" is a university project made during the first course of Computer Engineering at UC3M in collaboration with @angelmrtn.

It consists of an arcade game with a theme inspired by the lemmings. The main goal of this project was to experiment with Python properties and the library **pyxel**. Both the game logic and sprites were developed by the owner of this repository and his co-author.

## Game Rules
The Lemmings game has 1 main goal: get as many lemmings as possible to the finish portal from the starting portal. To do so, the player will have several tools that can be used. If a lemming falls from too high, it will die.

The tools are the following:
- **Ladders:** Help the lemmings go up and down in any direction. Ladders are not built instantly but they will be built one piece at a time every time a lemming touches it.
- **Umbrellas:** If a lemming is falling and it touches an umbrella, it will start falling slowly and won't die once it touches the ground.
- **Shovels:** Very useful tool whose role is to break platforms. Holes won't be made instantly, instead, lemmings will have to walk over the platform with the shovel several times for the platform to break.
- **Blockers:** Very useful for controlling the lemming's movement, blockers act the same way as platforms but they can be placed by the player.

**NOTE:** All tools have limited uses so be careful when you place one!
